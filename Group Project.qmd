# 1. Chosen Data Visualization Example

We selected the **Our World in Data: HDI vs GDP per Capita** visualization (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/human-development-index-vs-gdp-per-capita" target="_blank">link</a>).

This scatter plot shows **GDP per capita (PPP-adjusted)** vs **HDI** from 1990–2021, helping users explore economic prosperity and human well-being globally. It is widely used for policy analysis and sustainable development discussions.

# 2. Critical Analysis of Strengths and Weaknesses

| **Strengths** | **Weaknesses** |
|---|---|
| Shows GDP-HDI correlation clearly | Axis labels lack clarity |
| Interactive and engaging | Overlapping points, low contrast |
| Uses recognized indicators | No trendlines/regression |
| Temporal slider enables time analysis | No filters by income/region |
| Visually appealing design | Not color-blind friendly |

# 3. Proposed Improvements

The current visualization is broad and lacks a clear narrative. To enhance it, we will:

4. Filter by Country Development Status

> Introduce a filter that allows users to display **only developed countries**, **only developing countries**, or **both** within the visualisation. This improvement will enable targeted data exploration and clearer comparisons across different development classifications.

5. Dynamic Yearly Summary Panel

> A **dynamic summary panel** will be added to **display key statistics for each year** as users interact with the timelapse animation. The panel will display the **average HDI and GDP for developed and developing countries**. It will also show the number of countries in each group, along with their **minimum, median, and maximum values**. This feature will provide users with clear and comparative insights at a glance, enhancing the interpretability of trends across different development classifications throughout the visualisation.

6. Animated Timelapse with Annotations

> Implement an **animated timelapse feature** to showcase changes in the data visualisation over time. The animation will pause at key milestones with clear, concise annotations to **highlight significant trends and shifts**. This improvement will enhance user engagement while providing contextual insights to support deeper understanding during playback.

These changes will transform the visualization into a **focused, insightful tool centered on the global development gap** while maintaining interactivity and clarity.



# 4. Data Sources and Sample Data

**Data sources:** UNDP, Human Development Report (2025); Eurostat, OECD, and World Bank (2025); HYDE (2023); Gapminder - Population v7 (2022); UN, World Population Prospects (2024); Gapminder - Systema Globalis (2022); Our World in Data – *with major processing by Our World in Data*.

These sources are compiled within the **Our World in Data HDI vs GDP per Capita visualization**.
