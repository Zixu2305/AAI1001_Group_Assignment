# 1. Chosen Data Visualization Example

We selected the **Our World in Data: HDI vs GDP per Capita** visualization (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/human-development-index-vs-gdp-per-capita" target="_blank">link</a>).

This scatter plot shows **GDP per capita (PPP-adjusted)** vs **HDI** from 1990–2021, helping users explore economic prosperity and human well-being globally. It is widely used for policy analysis and sustainable development discussions.

# 2. Critical Analysis of Strengths and Weaknesses

| **Strengths** | **Weaknesses** |
|---|---|
| Shows GDP-HDI correlation clearly | Axis labels lack clarity |
| Interactive and engaging | Overlapping points, low contrast |
| Uses recognized indicators | No trendlines/regression |
| Temporal slider enables time analysis | No filters by income/region |
| Visually appealing design | Not color-blind friendly |

# 3. Proposed Improvements

The current visualization is broad and lacks a clear narrative. To enhance it, we will:

- **Focus Narrative:** Compare **developing vs developed countries** to highlight global inequality.
- **Data Refinement:** Extract and clean relevant subsets to support this narrative.
- **Regional & Outlier Analysis:** Identify patterns and outliers by region and economic classification.
- **Trendlines:** Add regression lines to quantify GDP-HDI relationships.
- **Dynamic Filtering:** Enable filtering by region, income group, and year to reduce clutter.
- **Accessibility:** Improve labels, add color-blind-friendly palettes, and enrich tooltips.
- **Annotations:** Highlight key countries and events for context.
- **Guided Panels:** Provide narrative panels to aid interpretation.

These changes will transform the visualization into a **focused, insightful tool centered on the global development gap** while maintaining interactivity and clarity.



# 4. Data Sources and Sample Data

**Data sources:** UNDP, Human Development Report (2025); Eurostat, OECD, and World Bank (2025); HYDE (2023); Gapminder - Population v7 (2022); UN, World Population Prospects (2024); Gapminder - Systema Globalis (2022); Our World in Data – *with major processing by Our World in Data*.

These sources are compiled within the **Our World in Data HDI vs GDP per Capita visualization**.
