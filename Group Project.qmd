# 1. Original Data Visualization in News Media

We selected the **Our World in Data: HDI vs GDP per Capita** visualization (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/human-development-index-vs-gdp-per-capita" target="_blank">link</a>).

This scatter plot shows **GDP per capita (PPP-adjusted)** vs **HDI** from 1990–2023, helping users explore economic prosperity and human well-being globally. It is widely used for policy analysis and sustainable development discussions.

# 2. Critical Analysis of the original visualization

The Our World in Data HDI vs GDP per Capita visualization plots **GDP per capita (log scale)** against **Human Development Index (HDI)**, using **countries as data points sized by population and colored by region**. Its **interactive temporal slider (1990–2023)** and **hover tooltips** allow users to explore how countries' HDI and GDP per capita have evolved over time, while enabling detailed examination of specific countries and outliers.

The visualization effectively communicates the global relationship between economic prosperity and human development, providing a clear, engaging overview suitable for policy discussions and educational contexts. It allows for comparative regional analysis and exploration of patterns across countries with differing income levels within a single view.

The table below summarises these strengths and weaknesses clearly for quick reference:

| **Strengths** | **Weaknesses** |
|---|---|
| Shows GDP-HDI correlation clearly | Axis labels lack clarity |
| Interactive and engaging with tooltips | Overlapping points in dense regions |
| Uses globally recognized indicators | No trendlines/regression analysis |
| Temporal slider enables year exploration | No filters by region, income group, or custom years |
| Color-coded by region for broad comparison | Not color-blind friendly, low contrast |
| Population-sized bubbles add depth | Bubble sizing overshadows smaller countries |
| Log scale compresses wide GDP range effectively | Population sizing methodology unclear |

# 3. Proposed Improvements

The current visualization is broad and lacks a clear narrative. To enhance it, we will:

## 1. Define a focus narrative

> **Developed countries** are typically characterized by both **high human development** and **high economic output per person**. In contrast, **developing countries** may exhibit **lower human development**, **lower income per capita**, or **both**.  
>
> This classification allows us to better understand **disparities in global development** and provides a meaningful basis for **comparative analysis**.

To operationalize this using the dataset’s two key variables:

- **Human Development Index (HDI)**
- **GDP per capita** (PPP, constant international $)

We define the categories as follows:

- **Developed countries**:  
  - **HDI ≥ 0.800**  
  - **GDP per capita ≥ $12,536**

## 2. Add Contextual Bands Along X & Y Axes

>To enhance interpretability, we propose adding **shaded bands or labeled regions** along both axes to reflect internationally recognized **development and income classifications**. This helps viewers quickly assess where each country falls on the development spectrum.

**HDI Axis (Y): Human Development Levels (UNDP Standards)**

We divide the HDI range into four tiers:

- **Low HDI**: 0.000 – 0.549 
- **Medium HDI**: 0.550 – 0.699 
- **High HDI**: 0.700 – 0.799
- **Very High HDI**:0.800 – 1.000

**GDP per Capita Axis (X): Income Groupings (World Bank Standards)**

We segment GDP per capita into income categories as follows:

- **Low Income**: < $4,046  
- **Lower-Middle Income**: $4,046 – $12,535  
- **Upper-Middle Income**: $12,536 – $41,999  
- **High Income**: ≥ $42,000

The result is a more **narrative-driven** and **policy-relevant** visual that supports clearer analysis and storytelling.


## 3. Add Boundary Threshold Lines for Developed vs Developing Classification

>To clearly separate **developed** and **developing** countries in the chart, we will add **two threshold lines** based on international standards: 

- **HDI ≥ 0.800** (Very High Human Development – UNDP)
- **GDP per capita > $12,536** (High Income – World Bank)

These lines help to:

- Visually split the chart into four clear zones
- Make it easy to spot which countries are developed or developing
- Support the focus narrative with a clear, visual definition

## 4. Filter by Country Development Status

> Introduce a filter that allows users to display **only developed countries**, **only developing countries**, or **both** within the visualisation. This improvement will enable targeted data exploration and clearer comparisons across different development classifications.

## 5. Dynamic Yearly Summary Panel

> A **dynamic summary panel** will be added to **display key statistics for each year** as users interact with the timelapse animation. The panel will display the **average HDI and GDP for developed and developing countries**. It will also show the number of countries in each group, along with their **minimum, median, and maximum values**. This feature will provide users with clear and comparative insights at a glance, enhancing the interpretability of trends across different development classifications throughout the visualisation.

## 6. Animated Timelapse with Annotations

> Implement an **animated timelapse feature** to showcase changes in the data visualisation over time. The animation will pause at key milestones with clear, concise annotations to **highlight significant trends and shifts**. This improvement will enhance user engagement while providing contextual insights to support deeper understanding during playback.

These changes will transform the visualization into a **focused, insightful tool centered on the global development gap** while maintaining interactivity and clarity.



# 4. Data Sources and Sample Data

**Data sources:** UNDP, Human Development Report (2025); Eurostat, OECD, and World Bank (2025); HYDE (2023); Gapminder - Population v7 (2022); UN, World Population Prospects (2024); Gapminder - Systema Globalis (2022); Our World in Data – *with major processing by Our World in Data*.

These sources are compiled within the **Our World in Data HDI vs GDP per Capita visualization**.
