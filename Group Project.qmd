# 1. Original Data Visualization in News Media

We selected the **Our World in Data: HDI vs GDP per Capita** visualization (<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/human-development-index-vs-gdp-per-capita" target="_blank">link</a>).

This scatter plot shows **GDP per capita (PPP-adjusted)** vs **HDI** from 1990–2023, helping users explore economic prosperity and human well-being globally. It is widely used for policy analysis and sustainable development discussions.

# 2. Critical Analysis of the original visualization

The Our World in Data HDI vs GDP per Capita visualization plots **GDP per capita (log scale)** against **Human Development Index (HDI)**, using **countries as data points sized by population and colored by region**. Its **interactive temporal slider (1990–2023)** and **hover tooltips** allow users to explore how countries' HDI and GDP per capita have evolved over time, while enabling detailed examination of specific countries and outliers.

The visualization effectively communicates the global relationship between economic prosperity and human development, providing a clear, engaging overview suitable for policy discussions and educational contexts. It allows for comparative regional analysis and exploration of patterns across countries with differing income levels within a single view.

The table below summarises these strengths and weaknesses clearly for quick reference:

| **Strengths** | **Weaknesses** |
|---|---|
| Shows GDP-HDI correlation clearly | Axis labels lack clarity |
| Interactive and engaging with tooltips | Overlapping points in dense regions |
| Uses globally recognized indicators | No trendlines/regression analysis |
| Temporal slider enables year exploration | No filters by region, income group, or custom years |
| Color-coded by region for broad comparison | Not color-blind friendly, low contrast |
| Population-sized bubbles add depth | Bubble sizing overshadows smaller countries |
| Log scale compresses wide GDP range effectively | Population sizing methodology unclear |

# 3. Proposed Improvements

The current visualization is broad and lacks a clear narrative. To enhance it, we will:

- **Focus Narrative:** Compare **developing vs developed countries** to highlight global inequality.
- **Data Refinement:** Extract and clean relevant subsets to support this narrative.
- **Regional & Outlier Analysis:** Identify patterns and outliers by region and economic classification.
- **Trendlines:** Add regression lines to quantify GDP-HDI relationships.
- **Dynamic Filtering:** Enable filtering by region, income group, and year to reduce clutter.
- **Accessibility:** Improve labels, add color-blind-friendly palettes, and enrich tooltips.
- **Annotations:** Highlight key countries and events for context.
- **Guided Panels:** Provide narrative panels to aid interpretation.

These changes will transform the visualization into a **focused, insightful tool centered on the global development gap** while maintaining interactivity and clarity.



# 4. Data Sources and Sample Data

**Data sources:** UNDP, Human Development Report (2025); Eurostat, OECD, and World Bank (2025); HYDE (2023); Gapminder - Population v7 (2022); UN, World Population Prospects (2024); Gapminder - Systema Globalis (2022); Our World in Data – *with major processing by Our World in Data*.

These sources are compiled within the **Our World in Data HDI vs GDP per Capita visualization**.
